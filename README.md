## Setup

### Backend (Laravel)

4. `php artisan key:generate`
5. `php artisan migrate --seed` (or `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` for a reset)
6. Start the backend: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public`
7. (Optional) Start the price fetcher: `php artisan schedule:work` or run manually: `php artisan stocks:fetch-prices`

### Frontend (React)
1. `cd web`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

### Usage
- Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
- Register a user, log in, and start "trading"!

## Notes
- Only 10 stocks are supported (see `SymbolsTableSeeder`)
- Prices update every 10 minutes (by default)
- For charting, use the historical data in the `stock_prices` table
